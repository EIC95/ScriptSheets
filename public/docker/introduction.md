# Introduction

## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to create, deploy, and run applications in containers. A container is a lightweight and portable unit that includes everything an application needs to run, such as its code, libraries, and dependencies.

## Why use Docker?
- **Portability**: Runs on any machine with Docker installed.
- **Isolation**: Each container operates independently, preventing environment conflicts.
- **Lightweight**: Faster and less resource-intensive than virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Easy to deploy and orchestrate in cloud and microservices environments.

## Difference Between a Virtual Machine and a Container
| **Aspect**      | **Virtual Machine**  | **Container**  |  
|---------------|---------------------|--------------|  
| Startup Time  | Slow (minutes)       | Fast (seconds) |  
| Size         | Gigabytes (GB)      | Megabytes (MB)  |  
| Isolation    | Full (dedicated OS)  | Shares host kernel |  
| Performance  | Consumes more resources | Lightweight and efficient |  

## How Does Docker Work?
Docker operates with the following architecture:
1. **Images**: Read-only templates containing everything needed to run an application.
2. **Containers**: Running instances of images that operate in isolation.
3. **Docker Engine**: The service that manages the creation and execution of containers.
