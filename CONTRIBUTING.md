### 4. Adding New Notes
To add a new technology or topic, follow these steps:

#### 4.1 Update Navigation
1. Open `Navbar.jsx` and add the new technology to the `technologies` array.
    - Include:
        - The technology name
        - The folder name inside `public/`
        - The path to the first page
        - The icon file name (stored in `assets/`)
        - A suitable color that works for both dark and light themes
```json
{ name: "MongoDB", directory: "mongodb", path: "mongodb/basics", icon: "mongodb.svg", color: "#00684A" }
```

2. Open `Content.jsx` and update the `technologies` array with:
    - The technology name
    - The folder name
    - The link to its official documentation
    - The name of the documentation website
```json
{ name: 'MongoDB', directory: 'mongodb', doc: 'https://www.mongodb.com/docs/', docSite: 'mongodb.com' }
```

3. Open `Home.jsx` and update the `technologies` array with:
    - The technology name
    - The path to the first markdown file
    - The icon file name (preferably in `.svg` format)
```json
{ name: 'MongoDB', path: 'mongodb/basics', icon: 'mongodb.svg' }
```

#### 4.2 Writing Notes in Markdown
- Notes should include:
    - Tables (optional), bullet points or numbered lists and code examples
    - Titles for topics using `# Title`
    - Subtitles for sections using `## Subtitle` (so they appear in the right sidebar navigation)

- Folder structure:
    - Each technology has a folder in `public/`
    - Each topic has a separate markdown file
    - File names should follow the technology name and topic

- `README.md` in each technology folder:
    - Starts with the technology name (`# Technology`)
    - Contains an ordered list of topics so they appear properly in the sidebar
    - The file names has to be the same as the topic or an alternative name separated by '_'

#### 4.3 Adding a New Notes to the Sitemap

To improve SEO and ensure that search engines index new technologies properly, each newly added language must be included in the `sitemap.xml` file.

##### Steps to Update `sitemap.xml`

1. Open the `public/sitemap.xml` file.
2. Add a new `<url>` entry following this structure:

```xml
<url>
    <loc>https://scriptsheets.eic.codes/technology-name/first-subject</loc>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
</url>
```
